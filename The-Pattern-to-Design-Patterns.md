# The Pattern to Design Patterns

### Chris Russell | @crussell52

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

## Characteristics

* Solves a "common" problem

* Reusable

* Instructions Only

* Assumes Prerequisite Skills

* Discovered, not invented **

IS OKAY to re-invent the wheel, might not always work but you learn something

## Discovering Design Patterns

* What problem is being solved?

* How is the problem solved?

* What should we call it?

## Recognizing Design Patterns

Does it solve the same problem in the same way?

## Learning Design Patterns

The problem is the answer

* focus on the problem

* Learn the problem

* Remember the name

* look at the solution

## Implement Design Patterns

The problem is STILL the answer

* Identify the problem

* Find the Pattern that solves the problem

* Make sure it solves the right problem

* understand the solution

* implement the solution

## Anti-Pattern

Seemed like a good idea at the timeâ€¦

* Repeatedly implement to solve a common problem

* Actually does more harm than good

* There is an established Pattern which solves the problem best

Find time to learn Object-Oriented Design Principles; the Design Patterns demand it.

Practice makes perfect. Beware the Anti-Pattern.
